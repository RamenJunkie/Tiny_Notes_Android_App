# Tiny Notes Android App
A Basic Note Taking App for Android

The general point of making this app is to get  better feel for Github workflow and an idea on how to build android apps.

It may never amount to anything amazing but maybe it will.

The initial commit is a V2, the original version crashed when trying to make notes.  This version is a straight build based on [this tutorial](https://technobyte.org/create-notes-app-android-full-code-tutorial-simple-explanation/#comment-2060).

Some functionality I want to look into adding, in no particular order.
